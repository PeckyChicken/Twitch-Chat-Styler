# Twitch Chat Styler
This simple extension formats Twitch chat messages using Markdown syntax (like Discord pretty much).
The formatting is purely client-side and will only display for people who have the extension enabled.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
This extension is not endorsed by or affiliated with Twitch in any way.

Some Markdown features have been disabled for security reasons, notably buttons and hyperlinks. Others, such as lists, don't work due to Twitch messages being single-line.

This extension is dependant on 2 third-party libraries:
* Marked (for parsing Markdown)
* DOMPurify (for sanitizing HTML)

Both of these have been attributed in the attributions.txt file.
